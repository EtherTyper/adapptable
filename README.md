 # Adapptable

A simple web interface to select open-source components and plugins from the community,
and fuse the selection into a single application, to easily setup company tools. You'll be able to choose branding schemes, included license, specialized functionality for Python, meta-programming, etc., and much more about it!

# Usage
There are several recommended methods for installation of Adapptble:
- One way is to load this source folder into the default app folder in an Electron distribution, which is ```Electron.app/Contents/Resources/app/``` on Mac, and ```electron/resources/app``` on Windows and Linux.
- You could go to releases for the ```app.asar``` to put in replacement of the app folder.
- You could even get a sandboxed MAS build from the Mac App Store.
- You could get a self-extracting Windows build from the release archive.

# License

The application is propretary as of this moment.
