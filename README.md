<span style="font-size:3em">Derivatives</span><span style="font-size:1.5em"> for <span style="font-family: 'Gotham SSm A', 'Gotham SSm B', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">IntelliJ IDEA&trade;</span></span>

A simple web interface to select open-source components and plugins from the community, and fuse the selection into a single IntelliJ platform product, for easy IDE setup. You'll be able to choose branding schemes, included license, specialized functionality for Python, meta-programming, etc., and much more about it!

# Usage
There are several recommended methods for installation of Derivatives:
- One way is to load this source folder into the default app folder in an Electron distribution, which is ```Electron.app/Contents/Resources/app/``` on Mac, and ```electron/resources/app``` on Windows and Linux.
- You could go to releases for the ```app.asar``` to put in replacement of the app folder.
- You could even get a sandboxed MAS build from the Mac App Store.
- You could get a self-extracting Windows build from the release archive.

# License

**_NOTE:_** Items in ```resources``` are not subject to the following license, though all of their uses are appropriate and allowed in the circumstances of the Derivatives application. And feel free to contribute! I'm always looking for new features and functionality in both the app and the IDEs it creates!
